 Topic: Five‐class classification of heart sound signals using the short‐term Fourier transform features.
 Objective:  Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify heart sound signals into five categories: normal and four abnormal conditions (AS, MVP, MS, MR) and 
 utilizing the Yaseen Khan Dataset, comprising heart sound signals sampled at 8000Hz, with each category containing 100 normal signals and 400 signals for each abnormal 
 category.
 Methodology: Train and evaluate the proposed CNN model on the Yaseen Khan Dataset. Implement signal processing and machine learning techniques on PCG signals for efficient 
 study and diagnosis of cardiac conditions.
